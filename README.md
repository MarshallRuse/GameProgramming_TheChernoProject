# GameProgramming_TheChernoProject
My following along of TheChernoProject's Game Programming series to create a Realm of the Mad God-like 2D game. Source (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98eOOCk2fOFg7Qg5yoQfFAdf)


The master branch of this repo will for the most part be copying and following along TheChernoProject, with overly verbose comments in the code to explain to myself/make notes of most (even rudimentary) parts of building a game from scratch. 

Later on I may create a branch with my own code in an attempt to expand on the game. This will be clearly marked
